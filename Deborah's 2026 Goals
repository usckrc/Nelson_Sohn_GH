1. Complete my Master’s degree Capstone Project

	We’re going to make this happen. I already hear `Pomp and Circumstance` in my ears.

2. Do a tutorial for snRNAseq or the preceding steps like nuclei isolation

	This is going to be so so so so so useful!

3. Figure out and utilize Rmd and other useful coding tools for analysis
	
	Love how this is synergistic with goal #2.

4. Attend at least 5 seminars/ talks/ research paper meetings
	
	I’ll try to keep you updated about departmental events to attend!

5. Successfully facilitate undergrad research/assistance

	I’ve love to help you flex your mentoring muscles! I already can see a few projects where you can help others in the lab grow!
